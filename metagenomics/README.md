# GeneLab bioinformatics processing protocol for Illumina metagenomics data (read-based analysis)

> **[`GL-DPPD-7102.md`](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/mock-temp/blob/master/metagenomics/GL-DPPD-7104.md) holds an overview and some example code of how GeneLab processes Illumina metagenomics datasets using a read-based analysis approach. Exact processing code for specific datasets that have been released is available in this repository [here](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/mock-temp/tree/master/metagenomics/processing-code) and is also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
