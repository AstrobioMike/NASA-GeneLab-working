# GeneLab bioinformatics processing protocol for Illumina amplicon sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7104-A.md`](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/mock-temp/blob/master/amplicon/GL-DPPD-7104-A.md) holds an overview and some example code of how GeneLab processes Illumina amplicon datasets. Exact processing code for specific datasets that have been released is available in the [processing-code](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/mock-temp/tree/master/amplicon/processing-code) sub-directory and is also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
