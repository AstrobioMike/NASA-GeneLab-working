# GeneLab bioinformatics processing protocol for Illumina metagenomics data (assembly-based analysis)

[`GL-DPPD-XXXX.md`](GL-DPPD-XXXX.md) holds an overview and some example code of how GeneLab processes Illumina metagenomics datasets using an assembly-based analysis approach.

# Details for reviewing

* The primary GeneLab protocol document for review highlighting the main steps/programs and with some example code is [here](GL-DPPD-XXXX.md).

* An example was done with 2 samples from [GLDS-286](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-286/). 
  * The above [example-output directory](example-output) holds the output files for your perusing pleasure, or the whole thing can be downloaded to your computer as a zip file by [clicking here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24696695) (it is ~63MB compressed and ~243MB uncompressed).

  * It is done with a Snakemake workflow, the primary snakefile is [here](example-output/processing_info/Snakefile).

  * The `README.txt` in the example-output directory describes the contents and can be found [here](example-output/README.txt), and is also pasted below.
  
Thanks! ðŸ™‚
